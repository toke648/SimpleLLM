His remarks came as Moscow pressed its advantage on the battlefield, retaking territory in the Kursk region where Ukraine has been waging a counter-incursion. Russian forces had wrested back control of the town of Sudzha, the Russian defence ministry claimed, a day after Putin visited the area.

Troops had also liberated two nearby villages, Podol and Melovoy, the ministry said, with a major-general predicting the operation to “cleanse our territory from the enemy” would be completed within days.

With about 6,000 inhabitants, Sudzha was the most significant settlement seized by Ukraine during its advance into the region, which began swiftly in August 2024. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the general staff, told Putin on Wednesday that in the previous five days Russian forces had regained 24 settlements from the Ukrainians, the defence ministry added.

Gerasimov also told the president that 600 Russian soldiers had walked 15km through an empty gas pipeline in order to attack Ukrainian positions. Ukraine did not confirm the loss of Sudzha but independent analysts reported that Russia had partially or fully seized the town.
