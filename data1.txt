“He is in fact preparing a rejection at present, because Putin is of course scared to tell President Trump that he wants to continue this war, that he wants to kill Ukrainians,” Zelensky said. “That’s why in Moscow they are imposing upon the idea of a ceasefire these conditions, so that nothing happens at all, or so that it cannot happen for as long as possible.”

Zelensky said Washington had expressed readiness to organise control and verification of the ceasefire. “This is possible to ensure, with America’s possibilities, and Europe’s possibilities,” he added.

The president said a ceasefire would give time “to prepare answers to all questions regarding long-term security and a real, reliable peace, and put on the table a plan to end the war”.

Trump, meanwhile, hosted the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, at the White House where he acknowledged Putin’s “promising” remarks, but warned that negotiations were far from complete. Speaking to reporters, Trump said that he would love to meet Putin. “But we have to get it over with fast,” he said. “Hopefully Russia will do the right thing.”

Trump said Washington was receiving “good signals” from the Kremlin. He added that discussions with Ukraine centred on “pieces of land that would be kept and lost”. Kyiv, however, insisted it would not recognise Russian rights over Ukrainian territory.

“We agree with the proposals to end military hostilities but we must proceed from the fact that the cessation must be one that leads to a long-lasting peace and eliminates the initial reasons for this crisis,” Putin said at a press conference with his staunch ally, Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus.
